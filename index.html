            <h3>Designer and Developer</h3>
            <p>
                I started learning how to code when i had a break from school.(Asuu Strike)
                A friend spoke to me about learning a skill rather than just being idle. I was skeptical,but i took a
                leap of faith.<br>
                I was like,how bad can it be? Started my classes and here i am, not regretting ever starting this
                journey and it's been an amazing one.<br>
                I am gathering alot of experiences in designing,developing websites and web applications.
